                This inspection reports any annotations
                @javax.annotation.concurrent.GuardedBy, @net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy or javadoc tag @GuardedBy@net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy
                where the guarding field
                is not final. Gaurding on a non-final field may result in unexpected race conditions, as locks will
                be held on the value of the field (which may change), rather than the field itself.
